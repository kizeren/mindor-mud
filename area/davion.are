Room of the Roleplayer~
You are now standing in a small room.  You can see all the program from
the code that runs the game running behind glass walls.  As you try to read
what the code is doing you notice that parts of it accually flash to
pictures and you can see dungeons, plains, and other parts of the realm.  We
all know they are not real but {wroleplaying{y is a necessity of the realm. 
Roleplaying is when you pretend to be part of the midevil realm.  Just try
your best and if you have any problems just ask...  People will usually help

Large Marble Corridor~
As you approach the end of the school you are standing in a HUGE marble
hallway.  There are gold accents all along the wall as the weave of magic
seems to have been inlayed in the walls themselves.  There is a small note
on the wall that may be of some help.

As you approach the end of this massive hall you can hear the small

during your tour through the school.

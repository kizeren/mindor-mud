{cKiomo Carpets{x~
{yCarpeting for every size of flooring lies draped around the walls of this
trading establishment. Closely woven and patterned carpets are rolled up and
left together, while several piles of rugs, barely better than thin hessian,
are left casually around the floor. Kiomo himself does little work here,
preferring to deal with the importing of new stock. He leaves the customer
service to a young apprentice. A sign on the door displays the latest special
offers.{x

{cThe Magical Music Shop{x~
{yThe persistent sound of a rather elaborate music box fills the small shop with
a complicated minuet. Powered not by conventional clockwork, but by magical
means, the music repeats itself but with subtle variations of tone and
melodies, gently creating a new tune every time. The shelves along one wall are
filled with sheet music, while the other wall is blocked by a matching set of
harpsichords. The back wall, behind the counter, holds several members of the
string family, cradled in silk harnesses.{x

{cThe Cessation of the Road{x~
{yEndeavor Road comes to a halt as it intersects the north to south road. The
streets to the north are decorated in colored cobblestones, a prime example of
the lavish disregard for expenses that mages have when it comes to spending on
their own environs. A strange odor emanates from a disreputable alleyway to the
east, where the mages obviously have no need to venture. With varied buildings,
the street continues to the south, although the skyline is dominated by a high,
square tower.{x

{cA Dingy Alleyway{x~
{yA severe difference exists between the clean and maintained roads of this area,
and the squalor of this alley. Piles of refuse are casually left against the
walls, and several puddles of foul-smelling liquids adorn the floor. A flotilla
of white feathers gently bobs on the largest of these puddles, drifting along
with the slight breeze. The main city wall is used to block the western end of
this passage, making a dead end of extremely unpleasant proportions. Despite
the stench and filth, the area seems to be free of rats and other sundry
infestations.{x

{cStreet of Chromatic Powers{x~
{yA broad, cobbled roadway is decorated with a large number of magical symbols,
picked out in a mosaic of colored stones. A cobblestone pentagram lies near a
runed magic circle, whose symmetry is marred by a steel manhole cover that
rests just to one side of the exact center. The sound of children learning by
rote can be heard coming from the building to the east, the unshuttered windows
allowing a view of a large classroom. To the west lies the ornate entrance to
the Nyxero Deio.{x

{yAn oaken panelled hallway greets the visitor, decorated with many signs for
direction to certain exhibits, while other signs provide specific information
in a tiny script. A reception desk faces the doorway, flanked by a pair of
suits of armor which are stood to attention. A number of students mill around
the floorspace, although their demeanor is less than enthusiastic. The work has
to be done, but there are no rules to say they have to enjoy it.{x

{cThe Main Exhibition Hall{x~
{yThis vast hall is filled with relics and artifacts from ages past. A sundial
shows the correct time, even inside, although it has several other shadows
which are unexplained. A number of warbanners, whose signs proclaim them to
imbue the wielder with leadership, adorn one wall, whilst its opposite is
decorated with magical shields. A large number of mystic weapons are held in a
display case along the center of the room, yet all the exhibits are encased in
thick, enchanted glass. The display glass is magically enhanced so as to repel
enchantments from without, barring those that contain the proper magical key.
The staff guard this information with jealous vigor, informing all inquirers to
seek the permission of the Archmagi.{x

perfect north to south route. The broad flagstones of the walkway appear to be
freshly laid, with no signs of wear from the passage of the many citizens of
this city. The road itself is of great interest, with a number of symbols
picked out in colored cobblestones. Amongst the devices on view are a phoenix,
a sunburst and a runic symbol of unknown origin.{x

{yA gang of workmen toil around a large area of torn up roadway. A large pile of
discarded cobblestones lies to one side, blocking half the remaining walkway,
while a wagon stands nearby, bearing fresh cobbles for replacement. The
discarded stones seem to be serviceable enough, although the fresh ones are
colored in many hues. Standing by the wagon, a foreman peruses the work with
one eye on the laborers, and the other on several diagrams he carries.{x

{cMeeting Point of Knowledge and Power{x~
{yThis junction of two streets forms a perfect right angle, with the two
thoroughfares making their way south and east. The southern street appears to
have some form of roadworks in the distance, causing some slowing of the
traffic flow. There are always several visitors to the city congregated on this
corner, for to the west lies the mansion of Marious, the mage who guards
against the encroachments of the dreaded Catacombs. Open to viewing by the
public, the imposing oaken doors are slightly ajar.{x

{yElaborate cornices encircle the ceiling of this lavishly decorated hallway
Statuettes of important historical figures are set on stone pedestals along the
walls, intermingled with life-sized portraits of people wearing their finery.
Little expense has been spared by the City Council who provided this residence
for Orteus, yet he, according to rumor and gossip, is rarely to be found here.
The house is immaculately kept by a small army of servants, and the public is
allowed access as a generous gesture by the mage himself.{x

{cA Sitting Room{x~
{yDelicate wooden chairs and settees, lightly upholstered in blue velvet, are
arranged in a circle about a central leather armchair. This room, where Marious
greets his guests on those rare occasions he graces this place with his
presence, is tasteful in its simplicity. A silver tea service has been left in
the exact center of a small occasional table, ready for the moment he takes a
rest from his labors. One darkened corner of the room holds a mahogany drinks
cabinet, securely locked by ensorcelment and a devious mechanical catch. A set
of double doors opens to the entry hall to the south, while a set of French
windows opens onto a pleasant garden to the east.{x

bordered, while the flowerbeds are a riot of controlled color all year round.
Sweet-smelling foliage protrudes from earthen planters, filling the air with a
soft scent that is redolent of a more tropical climate. Flanked to the north
and to the south by a high stone wall, the garden extends to the east and ends
against the mansion to the west.{x

walls that surround this botanical paradise. Head-high bushes have been
cultivated, by exquisite skill, into the shapes of people and, on occasion,
animals. To one corner of the garden rests a gazebo, where any visitor can
shelter from the elements within its wood and glass frame.{x

of the city to flow freely. Wildly contrasting yellow curbs and red gutter
stones encourage the carts to stay within the bounds of the roadway
itself. The enchanted lampposts are flanked by a high, stone wall to the north
and some form of center of learning to the south.{x

{yFramed by a colorful gutter and curbing, the street carries traffic directly
east and west. Swept clean on a regular basis by the small army of janitors
that cover the city, the light debris from the passing carts and coaches has
little time to build up. A number of magically illuminated lampposts are
distributed evenly along the walkways, guaranteeing a continual light at all
hours of the day or night.{x

{yBroad and fair the street progresses, giving access to the fountain to the east
and continuing a distance to the west. Kept in good repair, the cobblestone
road is decorated with a red set of cobbles marking the gutters. Yellow
sandstone has been used to make the curb between the road and the paved
walkway, defining the areas with a vivid contrast. The low building to the
north is obviously something religious, with patterned stained glass windows
allowing light to enter. The southern building is apparently some form of
classroom, with wide, plain glass windows showing many rows of desks.{x

{cA Rent in the Fabric of Creation{x~
{yThe air is throbbing with sheer power as some mystic force takes near corporeal
form. Strange, impossible shapes can be barely discerned as they speed past
just within eyeshot. A number of students take short walks within this area,
small sparkles of light momentarily affixing themselves to their extremities.
Breathing is not difficult, yet the air tastes alive, somehow. Thick stone
walls can just be seen through the haze, surrounding this phenomenon on three
sides.{x

{yWith a wide road and decent paving, it is a wonder that there are so few
pedestrians on this avenue. Pleasant enough, flanked by well tended willow
trees, there appears to be little traffic along here, with a few students and
occasional citizens being all. In contrast to the rest of the quarter, this is
a restful area where life passes on at an unhurried rate. A huge, blank
building towers over the road to the north, while several domiciles are
arranged neatly to the south.{x

{yA row of willow trees lines the southern pathway of this avenue, a sharp
contrast to the rubble that lies to the north. A collapsed construction has
sheared from the large building that was on its west, leaving a field of
masonic devastation. Several sawn-off tree stumps line the northern walkway,
their original arboreal foliage broken off by the catastrophe that caused the
destruction. Untouched by whatever befell the wasteland, the southern edge of
the avenue hosts several houses of plain, yet sturdy, nature.{x

to the north is of a dirty and barely swept street, lined by low quality
housing on its east and a collapsed building on the west. The road to the west
is a quiet affair and, although hardly a rich district, in a good state of
repair and maintenance. Grassy areas lie to the south and east, although they
are in a rather unkempt and neglected state.{x

{cAccommodation Road{x~
{yThe smell of this area of the road is probably the reason for the lack of
interest shown by the janitors, for the filth and detritus are piled knee-high
in parts. The poorest of the student population reside here, dwelling in
perhaps the greatest reason to study and advance. A large pile of rubble
replaces the apartment block to the west, the result of either extreme neglect
or a student prank. The eastern block has large cracks in the brickwork near
the floor, something that does not inspire confidence.{x

across the road to the east, stands in a state of utter disrepair. The various
scorch marks on the bricks littering the floor, however, suggest a fire or
explosion. A few charred timbers stick out of the debris, their charred ends
saluting the final end to a sizable building.{x

{yThe smell of decay meets all visitors, yet the inhabitants of this block,
students from the poorest families, seem not to mind. Cheerfully nodding in
passing, they seem happy enough despite the filth and stains. The stairs that
once led to the upper floor have rotted away entirely, leaving the residents
much less space to live in. The atmosphere is genial, the genuine good nature
of the truly impoverished.{x

housing. The area before the apartments has all the hallmarks of a student
area, with empty beer kegs prominent amongst the litter. A shop to the west
services the needs of the local population, its door open at all times of day
and night to accommodate the local inhabitants, their nocturnal habits
legendary in many realms.{x

housekeepers, but there are apparently some standards they do not let slip.
Several piles of books rest next to a large wooden staircase that rises to the
next level of the building. A large oaken door allows an exit to the street
outside, across which a busy little shop can be seen.{x

the result of a recent fire. The debris surrounding the area, half eaten food
and discarded drinking vessels, suggest this to have been from the previous
night. A couple of comatose students lie upon the grass near some bushes, their
bodies contorted into positions that they shall surely regret upon waking. An
ill-defined earthen trail wends its way east, to the streets of the city, and
south.{x

inviting the casual visitor to rest and relax. Despite the lack of attention to
the park itself, a number of students appear to be taking their ease on the
small islands of green. Several solitary, robed youths are seated, so engrossed
in their books that they are oblivious to the world around them. On one larger
patch of grass, however, a group of nearly a dozen of their contemporaries are
attempting to empty the contents of a large keg of a foaming beverage. An
earthen trail winds to the north and to the east.{x

are rather sumptuous in appearance, with finery and decoration much in

rather functional style. Far to the west lies the main square of the area,
where occurs much of the area's social intercourse. In the opposite direction

older colleagues looking more confident, standing around and smoking a crafty
roll up. Occasionally, the taller figure and full pointed hat of a tutor stands
above the crowd, a short lived area of calm following in their wake.{x

citizens. Fully acclaimed mages seem to be making their way to the south,
ignoring the older students who are making their way to a tavern that lies on
the northern side of the square. Younger students seem to be concentrated to
the west, for in that direction lays the learning center for all practitioners
of the magical arts. Familiar with the spectacle of so many mages in such a
small space, the normal citizens carry on their business undeterred.{x

declares it to be the "The Tea Diner". A rather less refined establishment
sits to the north, offering refreshments of a headier nature. A number of
hansom cabs rest nearby, their drivers seated and enjoying a relaxing drink. An
unwritten convention sets this outside area aside for use by normal people, yet
an elderly mage is seated on one bench by himself, dozing gently. Many sideways

displays of finery and ostentation. Windows carved from sheets of crystal
refract the light in spectral displays while rare, and dangerous, plants are
tended with care in the roadside gardens. Many houses are guarded by high walls
or thick iron railings, allowing their owners to rest undisturbed. The more
worrying houses are the ones that have no obvious protection. Something must be

statue of a famous merchant from history stands at the entrance to the square,
staring blankly into space and ignored by all. Thick stone walls baffle the
sound of the market salespeople, with the few windows visible being tightly
shuttered against the din. Perhaps the most noticeable feature is the

gambling chips, as are above. Several impeccably dressed servants carry out the

times past, denaturised to keep them safe from prying hands. Armor and weaponry
of warlords, skeletons of major daemons held together by wire, scepters from
fallen kings and vestments from conquered highpriests are displayed for all to

{cHellion Court, North of the Exiguous Quarter{x~
{yA mural of a large hellion to the west, at bay in its den before a group of
heroes, has been defaced by some scallywag with a piece of charcoal. Somehow a
mustache does not seem right upon the visage of a mighty hellion. The local
population seem to be of a rough sort, many keeping to their own thoughts as
they ignore each other in their travels. Familiarity appears to be regarded as
a weakness, strength lies in numbers or in being unnoticed.{x

have been erected to bring light to the eternal dark. Stone steps lead upwards
to the castle far above, unsupported by anything physical yet sturdy enough to
take the weight of many travelers. To one side stands a simple stone arch,
unattached to anything but noticeable from the shimmering in the air within the
arch itself. A steady stream of people appear to be walking to this arch,
walking through and fading from view. Just as frequently, people solidify from
air on the other side, pausing and then going about their business.{x

{yA rather eclectic mixture of travelers makes their way through this junction,
with scribes mingling with merchants and mages rubbing shoulders with beggars.
The road to the east leads directly to the very heart of the city, the view in
this direction dominated by Castle Tyvenia. The southern road runs all the way
to the impecunious district, while the northern road extends to the wizard's area.{x

{yA light twilight effect is caused by the edges of the shadow cast by Castle
Tyvenia, serenely floating to the west. Further to the east the shade recedes
to allow normal lighting from the sun, although the shade is ignored by the
citizens who are now inured to its effects. A steady number of people, local
inhabitants and adventurers alike, head towards the famed market to the east,
although some may be best advised to visit the public baths in that direction
instead.{x

passage of many a shopper, and the small army of janitors that the city employs
seems powerless to prevent the litter. Many of the people are moving either to

over the hubbub of the citizens. To the south stands a low building with a red-
tiled roof and an ornate plasterwork decoration beneath the eaves.{x

as usual, with shouts, importunings and some less savory forms of advertising
being quite audible. Opposing this to the south is the public baths, an
institution restored from a now-extinct civilization and brought back to life
and use by the mayor of this City. The citizens and adventurers traveling to

{cA Silent Cavern, Filled with Echoes{x~
{yThe echoes continue as you venture on. The narrow rocky cleft that was once
small, begins to transform into a dully lit cavern. At the far end of the room,
an orb hovers in the air, giving off a pulsating light. In the center of the
room, there is a skeleton of a long forgotten hero, pinned against an obsidian
column, by his own sword. Upon the hilt of the sword, a woman enshrouded in
complete darkness is carved, in amazing detail. You cautiously step forward,
your eyes fixated on the enormous rune-covered hilt of the sword. Oblivious to
the world around you, you step next to the skeleton and seize the hilt of the
sword. Archaic energies shoot through your body, as you withdraw the sword and
the skeleton falls to the ground. You turn to admire the swords beauty, and an
uneasy feeling overcomes you. You collapse to the floor incapacitated. Your
head spins as you hear the ancient words of a legend spewing forth, echoing as
the walls around begin to crumble. As you begin to cease to exist, a being
bends toward you. In an ancient language, somewhat similar to your own you
hear the words "You are worthy of salvation... may the echoes of silence play
through your mind forever... forever..forever...."{x

number is standing, preparing to question a man in the witness box. On the far
eastern wall, raised well above the floor and behind a large, wooden bench,
sits a black-robed judge. A wooden waist-high box stands against the northern
wall, the head-height rails that encompass it suggesting that this is for
dangerous defendants. The pair of burly guardsmen standing ready by this

not nearly as bad as tradition demands for such a place. This is probably due
to the temporary nature of the occupants, who are generally held here for but a
day or two before sentencing. A number of mirrored oil lamps are arrayed along

{cThe Main Cloister of Tyvenia{x~
{yThe crowds of adventurers that haunt this courtyard separate into two distinct
groups at this corner. Thirsting for knowledge, the fresh faced new arrivals
head to the library to the south. Ready to return to the fray and equipped for
combat, groups of seasoned warriors and spellcasters make their way to an area
even darker than the eternal twilight in the main yard. A number of glowing
globes guide the traveler's way to a strange archway in the center of the
court.{x

{cThe Main Cloister of Tyvenia{x~
{yBusy with the varied gatherings of citizens, the main courtyard in the City of
Medievia is a sight for the seasoned adventurer. Heavy slabs of granite have
been worked into an even surface that stretches to all corners of the area.
Veterans, bearing their scars, proudly arraign themselves in groups of their
peers, watched enviously by the fresh faced recruits that surge from the
Adventurer's guild to the south. The area is shaded by a massive construction,
just hanging in the air several hundred feet above. This can only be Castle
Tyvenia, the famed airborne construction, the last defense of the realm. This
floating behemoth causes a constant shadow on the courtyard, necessitating
magically illuminated globes to be set at intervals on posts. Many of these
lights are centered around a strange construction to the north-west, while
close by a somewhat friendlier cluster of lights invites the needy to seek out
the treasures in the donation room.{x

citizenry have designated this section to be the "Hellion's Tail". Far to the

Tail is intersected by a street that crosses from east to west. The blank wall

punctuated by many leaded windows, all with the shutters tied back to allow the

number of bricked-up windows and a large billboard. The billboard is colorful,

by with barely a glance, for this phenomenon is a permanent feature of the

{yA broad plaza of smooth paving stones surrounds an ornate spring, tinkling
gently as the water flows steadily. The water, coming from the various spouts,
is colored by some arcane means, with streams of water giving all the shades of
the rainbow. After a short while it becomes evident that there is something
more to this than first meets the eye. The water actually begins its journey an
inch above the fountain pool and makes its way up into the spouts, a
happenstance of no natural cause. A large, ornamental plaque declares this
spring to have been created by Quiope, Mosetaj's advisor in the war against
the denizens of the Catacombs. A second, smaller plaque appears to be of more
recent origin, and explains that the flows are due to a drunken student prank
some years ago. Apparently no-one has been able to return the fountain to its
previous state, yet the aesthetic effect is such that few would wish it to
change. Stone roads extend to the east, the west and the south from here.{x

trappings, greet the visitor in every direction. Narrow, stained glass windows
break the walls at regular intervals, each one reaching to near the low

of so many major magi and their own near-divine powers. An aisle goes to the

twenty feet of scorched and scarred flagstones then exists on the other side.
At the far end of the room, against a blackened wall, rest a number of wooden
targets of varying shapes and sizes. The targets are shaped into silhouettes of
various creatures, including humans, ranging from very small rabbits and
squirrels to large bears and dire wolves.{x

{cStreet of the Sapid Inveiglement{x~
{yThe stones of the road are pitted in small sections, with a couple of
spare ones lying in the gutter. This area of the street is rather quieter than
either of the areas to the north and south, with all traffic here just passing
through. An abandoned shop sits to the east, the door gaping open and
unattended. Opposing this on the west is a short alley, barely wide enough for
two carts to pass.{x

{cAlley of Gate{x~
{yA large pair of double gates end this alley on the western side. Attended by
some bored guards, they are obviously not used often, for on the other side
lies the Forbidden Forest. Despite the low importance of the alley, the area is
kept clean and tidy. The main area of the Wizard's Quarter is to the east, in the
area known to the locals as the Sapids.{x

{cAn Abandoned Shop{x~
{yAwaiting a new owner, the shop smells musty and somewhat stale. A few splinters
have been swept into one corner with little enthusiasm, while the layer of dust
on the floor has only been disturbed by a number of rodent trails. Brave
spiders have erected webs in the rafters, yet their efforts seem to be more in
optimism than any real sense.{x

{cStreet of Sapid Inveiglement{x~
{yNarrower than many of the other streets in this area, the Mellows, as the
locals refer to this area, are still more than wide enough for two carts to
pass. Less lively than the market area in the north, these streets are home to
the less popular, yet necessary, commercial establishments. The western side of
the street is taken by a shop selling carpets, while the light sound of music
comes from a shop to the east. A broad window allows a good view of several
musical instruments in there.{x

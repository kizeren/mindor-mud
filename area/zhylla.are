Shaded Path~
A worn path runs south through the thick forest, whose boughs tangle
overhead in a canopy of mosaic greens.  The light that filters through onto
the surface of the dirt and pebble footpath is a kaleidoscopic wonder of
emerald, peridot, jade, and malachite dapples that shift in the winds. 
Flowers of all colors poke their faces through verdant undergrowth,
brilliant gems belonging to all seasons.  You feel a sensation of quiet
serenity, hearing birdsong and the cries of wildlife that indicate peace. 
The chuckle of water running through stone drifts to your ears from further
south on the trail, tempting you onward.

Shaded Path~
The path continues south, and branches off slightly to the west, where
you can see the silver shine of water flowing from a deep spring.  A fresh
breeze dances through the leaves, carrying the scents of fruit tree blossoms
and earthy loam.  Although the light is dim, the forest does not feel
forbidding or unwelcoming.  Huge tree trunks testify the great age of this
peaceful forest, their knotted roots stretching deep into the stony core.

Shaded Path~
North and south the trail runs between the trees, winding through the
deep forest.  East, a fallen tree blocks the trail, though west the way is
clear.  Creepers twine around the thick branches of deciduous hardwoods,
their snake-like ends forming curtains where they have run rampant.  From
the northwest comes the laughter of running water, a merry sound that
mingles with animal calls from deeper in the forest.

tree~
It looks as if this tree fell victim to the delicate attentions of a
large bear.  Huge gashes were ripped out of the trunk and most of the bark
was rubbed off.  Most of it has disintigrated, but still it stands to block
your way.

This little trail runs west back to the main trail and on eastward, where
you can hear yips and soft growls.  Some bluebells shine bold sapphire at
the base of a tall maple, swaying gently.  A tiny spring, too small to even
sip from, gurgles up from a cluster of rocks and runs away into the ground
again.

A low cave has been formed here by the tumbling of rough white boulders. 
Its interior is dark but it stretches back and down, probably dug out by not

camoflaged by growths of ferns and moss and grass that took advantage of the
relative sun allowed by the absence of trees overhead; that selfsame sun
warms the lounging furry bodies around you that barely prick their ears at
your presence.

Shaded Path~
The path stretches on under the shade of ancient limbs and luscious
greenery.  The flora blooming beneath the strong branches is that of all
seasons; the crocus of spring flowers beside summer violets and autumn
dragonhead.  From the south, you feel a warm tingle on your spine- a
blessing and a promise of holy magic.  South on the path there is also an
intersection that splits two ways.

A Fork in the Path~
West of this fork in the path you can see through the trees a sunlit
clearing; east, a smaller path twines through an even darker portion of the
forest, where little light pierces through the canopy.  The path also
returns north.  Here the feeling of magic has grown much stronger; it is
almost palpable in the east.  A small wooden sign has been hung on one of
the branches, its carved script rough and almost archaic.

Dark Forest~
This tiny, dark trail winds through the forest like the curve in a great
wyrm's spine.  Here, only tiny shafts of light can find their way through
the dense leaves and branches above; it is almost impossible to see without
a light.  The trees here are so close together that your shoulders can
barely fit between them; the bark occasionally scores your arms and face. 
The smell of decaying leaves is cloying and sticks to the back of your
throat.  Giant ferns sway in your passing and sticks crack beneath your feet
as you continue onward.

tightness.  The earth beneath your feet is springy from layers of rotting
leaves; fern fronds sway in a slight breeze from the south.

Lone Altar~
The small clearing you emerge into is barely twenty paces across but
allows you a sense of space.  Here you can finally see the sky above and the
whole area is bathed in light; it is a definite relief from the cloistering
atmosphere beneath the trees.  Short sweetgrass brushes your boots as you
walk, the spicy scent of its crushed blades tickling your nose.  This area
is obviously quite special and must be sacred; around the circumference,
twelve tall bluestones have been arranged.  Even the air has a slight
glimmer to it, and you can feel the magic in your lungs as you breathe.

are arranged in a circle, like the twelve moon cycles of the year.  Their
hard dusty blue surfaces glint here and there with the inclusion of mica

Deep Forest~
Past this point there is no hope of making any further progress- you can
only go back the way you came.  Here the trees are so thick that they seem
to close about you and threaten to swallow you up and offer you to whatever
god has blessed this place.  You can hear growls and whistles and clicks
deeper within the primeval forest beyond, and the rustle of leaves and
branches.  You think you hear the padding of feet, but you cannot be sure.

light green stems waving idly as the wind bends them thither.  South the
little dirt path splits through the grass, and you think you can just make
out the tops of white columns.  The path also stretches east and west,
returning to the forest.

This trail is almost unnaturally silent, but you can sense no malevolence

through the leaves is nonexistant, though you see plants sway.  You idly

around clumps to show their bright faces to the sun.  You can see the tops
of gleaming white colomns to the south, brilliant in the light.  However,
most of the view is blocked by the thick stand of grass, making it almost
impossible to see beyond the next few steps in the grass.

Gleaming Columns~
The grasses have been totally cleared, leaving only a wide dusty area
bordered by trees.  Tall white stone columns lance up from the ground,
seemingly carved from boulders whose roots reach deep into the earth. 
Perhaps it isn't quite correct to label them as columns; they narrow as they
reach upward and flare outward into delicate rays, possibly even meant to be
flowers if viewed from above.  Just south of you is a broad white staircase
that leads into the welcoming confines of what seems to be a temple made of
the same rock prevalent throughout this forest.

Broad white steps ascend into a comfortable foyer that is open to the

green flames unaffected by wind and rain.  Yo.  Green flames that are
unaffected by wind and rain.  To the south, a large archway leads directly
into the heart of this temple, the Temple of Zhylla, Goddess of the

Clear water gushes from a crack in a clump of white stones whose surfaces
are mottled with moss and tiny white flowers.  It pours over round white
riverstones, whose pebbled banks your feet crunch across.  Younger trees
surround this river, flourishing in the light shining down onto the waters. 
Reflections are scattered by the vibrant motions of water racing over and
around stones, though here and there deeper parts of the water allow you to
glimpse images of yourself only mildly distorted by the current.  In those
places the silvery sides of minnows flash and gleam, and arthropods and
newts hide beneath rocks.

Dragonflies dance giddily in the air, flashing gems of sapphire, emerald,

Half of a wide log has been laid over the stream, its rough hewn surface
providing an unsteady bridge only slightly stabilized by a hand-railing
tacked on to one side.  The stream rushes on beneath you, merrily oblivious.
East and west the calm path continues, beneath the green leaves.  West is a
patch of brilliant red firestalks, their sharp blossoms bright against the
dark shades of brown and black.

only a few handspans above the rushing water, making you wonder why they
bothered building it at all.  The bridge itself was fashioned of a huge log
cut in half and laid with the "flat" side upright.

white stone ledges into a deep blue pool below.  You can't be sure, but
there seems to be a cave below the largest of the ledges.  A few trees lean
over the ridge, their hold precarious but advantageous over their brothers. 
The wet moss makes it too slick to go further, though a gold gleam far

A large tree fell across this path long ago, knocking down others in the
process.  It created a small cleaning where the sun could shine, allowing
other saplings to take root.  Large wildflowers also took root, spreading
their leaves and bright blossoms into the blessings of the sun, drinking in
the light and water that was allowed to fall to them instead of being stolen
by the huge trees.  Tall, spearlike flowers called "firestalks" bloom here
with buds as red as flame.

Beneath the tightly woven tree boughs are twelve bluestones arranged in a
circle.  Their surfaces are cold to the touch, and as you pass their
boundaries, you feel a cold chill bite at your flesh.  The bare earth is
covered in dark green vines whose leaves give off a faintly peppery scent;
here and there, the vines are dotted with small magenta berries that are
probably poisonous.  Behind every fourth stone there stands a huge live oak,
its deeply colored leaves preventing most of the sunlight from reaching the

You can't be sure how you missed seeing this marvellous structure from

forest, the enchantments of an elemental.  This hideaway has been carved
from the trunk of an unbelieveably huge living tree; and although it is
small, you have every assurance from its inhabitant that it is quite
comfortable.  The interior has been lovingly smoothed and coated with a
preservant that sealed out bugs and moisture; the dirt floor is hard packed
like stone.  Shelves line the walls, carefully bracketed to cause the least
harm to the trees.  They are covered in strange relics and bones, as well as

The archway you have stepped into is just long enough to be considered a

as the denizens of the woodlands she protects.  Inlaid into the stone is
soft antler ivory, fragrant red cedar, and dark mahogany, all softly
polished to gleam like gems in the daylight.  Scents of apple-like incense

you, some with farmers and woodcutters dozing, others with elven rangers
murmering prayers.  Beyond the pews to the east and west you can see
hallways that a few men and women walk in and out of; the pews also continue
into the temple.  The temple is lit by cunningly placed skylights of
transparent crystal that allow you to see the beautiful azure above.  The
light is pure and clear, making the temple's interior glow with a natural
magic its own.  Green vines trail along the white walls, which are inlaid

polishing and carrying.  There are several singers standing on either side
of the pulpit to your south, from where comes comforting, almost wordless
hymns.  On either of your sides beyond the pews there are alcolves in the
walls that are partially obscured by tapestries.  The plants within the
temple make it seem as wild as the forest outside; though the vines and
trees are well cared for, they are neither pruned nor forced to grow into
unnatural forms.

worship times- this goddess's children come and go to praise her as they
please.  A particularly large vine along the wall has bloomed, its vivid
blue flower contrasted by small white-veined leaves that almost completely
obscure the wall.  Its perfume overpowers the incense, but is not

Sacrificial Altar of the Lamb~
Once more you are indoors, although this is more like a greenhouse than
anything else.  Here the devoted of Zhylla leave their offerings- fruits,
grains, herbs, eggs, and other foodstuffs, as well as beautifully carved
statues of wood and stone, and baskets and weavings.  Acolytes scurry in and
out, carrying offerings to gods only know where.  Others leave baskets and
sheaves of things, saying a quiet few words in thankfulness or supplication,
and then disappearing.  In each of the cardinal directions a vine has
started along the wall, forming a lattice work that becomes more intricate
as it reaches the domed ceiling, with multicolored flowers and deceptively
simple leaves creating a fresco of natural wonder.

Hall of the Unblemished~
This hallway is little more than a path paved with white stones into the
outdoors.  White stone archways have been built at even intervals, woven
through like a lattice with vines and trees.  Wildflowers of yellow, pink,
and violet bloom along the path, in the cracks between stones which you
think may have been purposeful.  Here there is a cool, comforting breeze,
crisp and clear.  West it seems there is a seperately built chamber; east,
you can reenter the temple proper.

Basin of True Cleansing~
This chamber is detached from the whole of the temple, although except
for the entrance, it is enclosed.  The inner walls are carved with
painstaking designs of all the living plants and animals of the forests. 
The pictures must be one of the wonders of Mindor; there is no way anything
now living could have done such exquisite work.  In the center of the room
is sunk a wide, deep basin; the stone is dark gray where dry, but a soft
black where wet.  A bronze grate lies in the bottom, opened and closed by
two slim chains that reach to hooks on the walls.  If one pulls the northern
chain, the grate would open; if one pulled the southern, it would close.  A
clever device.

White Halls~
The green and silver tapestry that concealed this entryway was quite soft
to the touch.  This hallway is wide and well-lit by the wall sconces and
their magical flames.  Carvings adorn the white walls, telling the tales of
Zhylla in word and picture that were lovingly carved by some devoted
artisan.  Vines decorate the walls like living curtains, and fruit-bearing
plants peer out of tiny niches, offering you the sweetness of the rich
earth.  South of here is a carved door; east, the hall continues, and west
is back to the pews.

Confessional~
As you step into the chamber you see that this is indeed the temple's
confessional, where devotees come to lay bare their sins against their
goddess.  The room is soothing, with a floor of soft moss and a small stream
burbling over round gray stones.  A large boulder seems to serve as a seat;
dividing the domed room in half is a delicately woven sheet of thin living
vines that barely even reveals the silhouette of the one behind it.  On this
half of the room, you can see three windows in the curved ceiling that allow
light to pour through.

Vines curtain the carved walls, allowing peeks of carved white stone and
lace-like script between thick green ropes and leaves.  A swath of white
flowers has bloomed here, creating a delicate foamy carpet.  A large table
of script tells the story of Zhylla's children, who spread the seeds of the
living plants throughout the world.  A carved door blocks the entrance to a
southern room; east is the end of the hallway, and west is back to the
corridor's opening.

Priest Chambers~
It seems that whoever lives within this room is absent.  However, it has
a definite female touch about it.  The bed is comfortable and fairly plain,
though the thick quilt has roses embroidered across it and the bedposts are
flowerbuds.  A scarlet rug covers the floor, and a small wooden wardrobe
holds the priestess's vestments.  Beneath the window stands a red marble
sculpture of Zhylla, and at the foot of the bed is a dark oak chest.  Near
the door there is a clean desk.

Priest Chambers~
The priest in this room is definitely male.  A plush blue rug covers the
floor, simple in weave but beautiful.  A bed lies beneath the window, piled
with warm furs and quilts.  It seems as though celebacy is not a required
practice of this religion; a door joins this chamber to the western one,
though you cannot open it.  A footlocker holds many of the man's worldly
possessions, and a tall wardrobe holds his garb.

High Priest's Suite~
The High Priest's suite is a large, round chamber.  In the apex of the
domed roof there is a skylight, allowing the sun's rays to warm the room. 
In each of the cardinal directions a tree grows, trees not quite large
enough to go through the roof.  A small pond bubbles in the center of the
room, with colorful fish darting about tiny waterplants.  A folding screen
of carved oak conceals a small plain bed and a wardrobe.  Next to the
wardrobe is a stack of decorative boxes trimmed in gold, a gift from some
far-off city.  Covering the floor is a hand-woven rug of faded green,
probably some relic from childhood.

The blue and gold tapestry blocks much of the sunlight of the main
temple, although sconces on the wall light the narrow passage with magical
fire.  Many acolytes walk though the hall, busily cleaning and carrying, as
well as studying devotionals as they go.  One of the skills advocated by
this priesthood must be the ability to multitask.  To the south is a plain
pine door; west, you can see more of these doors.  The pews are to the east.

The acolytes' rooms are small but not uncomfortable.  Two bunkbeds are on

and the bunkbeds there are two desks with holy texts, scrolls, parchments,

pass; they wonder why you have come into their sanctum.  It seems that not
many come in here who haven't been ordained.  South of you is an uncarved
pine door; the corridor ends to the west, but you can go back to the pews to

supports for desks and cushioned chairs.  Acolytes work side by side at
translations with hooded monks and priests, pouring over thick tomes and
ancient scrolls at the tables in the center of the library.  Everything is

An Aelixer~
Aelixers of eternal life have been promised throughout the aeons to those
who would seek them.  However, few of them delivered upon those solemn
oaths- many gave the surprised wishers eternal undeath or worse, an eternal
life in a crumbling body.  Others made the drinkers or wearers into soulless
puppets, if not killing them outright.  These accursed potions have found
their ways into the hands of Zhylla's devoted priests, who dedicatedly
destroy them without succumbing to their own desires for life and happiness.
Beware to any who seek for ever in such a tiny package- will you live
eternally in pain, or paint your name in time for all to see?

Jewels and gold encrusted swords, shields, and mirrors lie ready to entrap

pitiable Narcissus and his admirer, Echo.  These items have captured the
souls of would-be owners for centuries, draining their lives and cursing
them to commit murder, steal, betray, and die for naught.  You shudder,
feeling their oily taint, but their beauty causes your eyes and hands to

nothingness once again.  The dark gray-stone lined hole in the ground is a

You hope that such is never your fate- for once you have reached the
pinnacle of a mountain, there is no other place to go but down.

aura exuding power and evil; you find yourself drawn to them, desiring them.
They have been carefully stacked and labelled, waiting for their turn of
destruction.  It seems that not only is the priesthood of Zhylla protecting
her sacred forest, but it is also using the library as a shield to procure
and destroy negative artifacts.  The walls and floor are of pure white stone
etched with holy symbols, seals, and channels to capture the evil force of
the items and canalize it into pure white energy.  No acolytes come into
this chamber, for the temptation to take the items and be possessed by them
is to strong, too much of an irresistable taint.  Only the ordained and
purified may enter here.

The Possessed~
Huge grimoires, sceptres, swords, and other items have been carefully
categorized onto shelves and sealed containers, resting on silk and other
energy-muffling devices.  Some of these have been possessed by great spirits
and demons whose desire is to contribute to the fall of creation and to
destroy all those living.  Others wish to live on the mortal plane, but
could find no fleshy vessel suitable for their souls.  Glowing runes and
sigils encircle the most powerful of these beautiful items, bedecked in
glittering jewels and precious metals.  You feel drawn to these, as your
darkest wants are tapped by the spirits, to help them escape, to give you
your fondest dreams...

And Haunted~
Electric chills arc their way up your spine and into the base of your
skull, making you shudder unwillingly.  This space is so cold that
goosebumps rise along your arms.  Books, weapons, trinkets- all these are
cursed items, haunted by long-dead souls who hunger to avenge themselves on
the living out of hate and envy.  Some wish to possess and damn other bodies
to hell; some remain out of a sadistic desire, or an inability to release
themselves from the sorrow and pain of their former lives.  These items wait
for exorcism.  From some you can hear moaning and humming.

For a Fiery Furnace~
Bulging from the south wall is a large clay-fronted furnace that releases
skin-tightening heat in powerful waves.  Stacks of items surround it,
waiting to be fed to purifying flames blessed to release the cursed spirits
within.  Urns of ash stand to one side, waiting to be prayed over and
released into sanctified ground, the remains of those evil things that are
brought to this chamber.

Concealed Stair~
Sneaking past the librarian was hardly a small task.  It seems as if he
had eyes...  Everywhere.  Now that you have, you may come to regret it. 
This small room, with its cramped and narrow staircase, is made of gray
stone made black by moisture you hear dripping from the ceiling and can see
through your light running down the walls and trickling over the cracks in
the masonry.  You may go down the staircase or head north through the hidden
door and hope the librarian doesn't catch you.

Verdant Contemplation~
Stepping out of the rather stifling library, you take a deep breath of
fresh air.  Aaah, the clearness- a great improvement over the stuffiness of
the books.  You have entered a comfortable grove of oak trees, a seeming
favorite of the clergy.  Short blue-green grass, bluets, and moss grow
beneath the trees and on the bark, with occasional sprinkles of lavender,
yellow, and white.  East you may return to the temple confines; west and
south you can enjoy Zhylla's bounty.

A Temptor's Whisper~
A pool gurgles joyously up from some unknown source, creating a relaxing
atmosphere.  Large mossy stones provide comfortable seats for meditators,
dry and soft.  The air is comfortably cool here, though warm where shafts of
sunlight reach through the fingers of the trees.  Fruit-bearing bushes and
passionflower have been encouraged to grow here; after all, one cannot
ponder the mysteries of the universe with a growling stomach.  A large
outcropping of gray-veined white stone has provided the perfect place for a
pitcher-plant to grow, its red-traced bloom reminding one that with beauty
comes a price.

The Healer's Vine~
The earth has been cleared to form a small kitchen garden as well as a
live herbalist's pantry.  Sheep's tongue, John's wort, nightshade, and
foxglove have been planted here, as well as willow, for its underbark's
pain-killing properties.  You can smell basil and sage and chives; overall,
you can see thyme and rosemary.  You feel quite at ease here; the atmosphere
is mellow and you find yourself dozing off.

A Home of Green Life~
An elaborate garden has been formed of nature's wild art.  Towering
grasses shiver in the air, while clematis and ivy are espaliered against the
broad trunks of elms.  Vast stone tumbles have become home to delicate
flowers and succulents and trickle tiny springs through the garden where
newts and salamanders and toads hide.  Bright violet monkshood proudly
proclaims its place, while vain snake's lace lounges lissomly in social
clusters.  South you can see a small building, while north you return to the
garden's entrance.

Harvest Grains~
You've discovered the temple's outdoor kitchen!  Since it is far too hot
to keep an oven inside the temple, the kitchen was put outside in the
garden, a practical decision.  The interior is stiflingly warm and makes
your pores weep; but the scent of baking bread and frying squash makes your
mouth water.  You also smell freshwater fish cooking and venison roasting. 
The clergy seems to have nothing against carnivorism.

Watershed~
Here an underground spring was dug into, creating a well and a cool
storage area for roots, canned foods, and fruits.  The stone add-on to the
wooden construction of the kitchen is dark and actually quite dry; you
suspect something like magic at work in that respect.  The packed dirt floor
is slightly uneven beneath your feet, causing strange patterns through the
soles of your boots.  Shelves of preserved food and dried herbs meet your
inspection.

A Soylent Dream~
Rows and rows of vegetables have been planted here.  You see okra,
lettuce, greens, corn, squash...  Orange pumpkins peek their heads out at
you from beneath huge leaves.  Aren't they supposed to ripen in autumn? 
Mustard greens have taken over a majority of the tilled earth; obviously,
for some unfathomable reason, they're a favorite.  Bright red and yellow
fruits catch your attention; they've been staked up, for the fruit is too
heavy for the bushy vine it grows on.  From the east wafts the smell of
cooking meat and baking bread; it's enough to make your stomach growl!

Warm Pastures~
Here you've come to a fenced in pasture where a few cows and goats are
kept for their milk; and when guests come, their horses range this paddock
as well.  It's comfortably warm, with a cool and clean pool for the
livestock to drink from and dustbowls to wallow in.  A small grove of trees
provides shade for lazy naps.  West is the stable, and east is the vegetable
garden.

This small barn-like structure houses the horses of visitors and
messengers as well as the cows of the temple.  It's warm and dry, and
comparatively clean thanks to the efforts of acolytes.  The sharp scent of
livestock still makes your nose cringe, though.  Thick layers of straw have
been placed over the dirt, periodically replaced to keep parasites from
becoming a difficulty.  East you can return to the paddock.

Butter, cheese, milk, and eggs are cradled carefully by woven rush
baskets.  Steaming loaves of bread are wrapped in cloth, and bowls of
filling cool to be placed into pies.  This is where the best of the kitchen
work is done- after all, who wants to be stuck in the ovens?  North are
those very same ovens, and west you can see trees through the doorless
entry.

of vegetable crops.  You stand within a meticulously tended grove of fruit
trees, particularly apple and, oddly, fig and pomegranate.  It's cool and
comfortable, and you see that you can take a seat on any of the carefully
formed limbs.  Here the air smells sweet, like decaying leaves.  West is
another entrance into the kitchens.

However, you feel as if you could be lost within the field.  Wind plays with

with; perhaps it's a bad idea to go further.

To Seal the Past~
You have descended into the mildewed depths of the temple's crypt.  Above
you, a secret door has slammed closed, not allowing you to leave these
confines.  There must be a way out!  The three doors around you are all
closed and by appearance locked and sealed with nigh infallible magic.  All
three are thick water-blackened stone as well.  The air in the underground
crypt is stale and musty.

insturments of post-death are stacked upon pedastals of differing heights,
each containter individual.

Shelves of urns line much of this dank chamber.  There is, oddly,
absolutly no odor to this room at all- as if it were totally sterilized.  On
the other half of the wall is a stack of skulls that reach up to the
ceiling.  The oldest are bright, gleaming white, while the newer are still
yellowed and not quite properly bleached.  This way of honoring the dead
saves the space needed for the forest; the bodies are buried and then, after
several years, disinterred and incinerated, with all but the skull's ashes
being sent back to relatives or friends.

A Watery Grave~
The darkness swallows you up into its monstrous gullet, squeezing you and
constricting you into a tight knot of tension.  You can only tell the walls
by the bare bit your illumination can bounce back from the masonry; dark
shadows brush your flesh and make you shiver.  It's cold and damp, and you
can hear the lap of water against stone and the gently horrifying whisper of
its rush through the narrowness of stone walls.  Tendrils of solid moisture
grasp at you and snare you until you realize that these are only the
subterranean roots of the trees above you.

of the older ones- the locks were rusted off and it was only a simple matter

stone sarcophagus, with others stood along the wall behind it.  Several
statues and other items have been left here as offerings to the soul in the
afterlife.

quite colder than it had been in the passage.  Spindly roots hang from the
ceiling, twining around the standing stone coffins and the weapons at
attention along the walls.  The damp mustiness in here makes you need to
cough violently, but, alas...  East you see a strong stone door leading to
the next chamber, and west you may enter the passage.

carved into this coffin, its form trapped within a perfect circle.  Two
beautiful sculptures stand to either side- one a graceful robed woman with a
pure {Wcrystal{x globe in her hands, the other a wistful looking man leaning on
a {Ygold{x-topped quarterstaff.  Roots have mostly hidden the friezes on the

protective of whomever is in the glass coffin.  The room is dark but
amazingly enough, dry.  No roots have penetrated the stone interior, whose
smooth walls are oddly free of decoration.  Besides the statues and the
coffin, nothing else resides within.

levels.  How odd...  East and west you see more doors.

Six stone statues of strong warriors, male and female, guard this narrow

arch-covered path.  The weapons glint coldly in your light; they are the
only metal present in the room.  The carved door to your east beckons, but

At first glance you are taken aback- there is no stone coffin in this
room!  However, upon closer inspection, you note a carved bronze plate in
the floor, six feet in length and wide enough for a man's shoulders.  The
priest here must be set into the stone.  Several precious vases have been
left here, as well as a few golden busts atop marble pedestals.  A tattered
rug has been hung on the east wall.  A breeze flutters its edges, emerging
from some invisible crack.

crypt under the guard of those loyal knights in the western room.  Their
twin sarcophagus bear their carved likenesses on the lid- one a woman, one a
man, with stone hands joining them even after death.  Gleaming silver
statues stand along the east wall, wearing robes and expressions of serene
joy.  The black walls shine with moisture; you can hear an occasional drip,
as well as see the shadows of roots above you.  A few have even grown on the
floor.

This tiny room holds several artifacts of power, almost screaming for you

layer of dust and energy; many priests must have spent their years casting
wards over it for the effect to be so palpable.  The walls are the dark gray
of the dry stone this crypt was dug from; the protections must extend far
into the thick bedrock.  Not even the roots have invaded its sanctity.

Crossed Swords~
Passing through the doors, you are met with a singularly peculiar sight
that draws your attention away from the rest of the room.  Before you, at
head height, two crossed swords have been frozen in the air.  Try as you
might, you can find no physical device which holds them there- no powerful
lodestones, no strings, no invisible stands.  This leaves magic as the only
alternative.  As you walk, they ghost ahead of you, shadowing your steps. 
It may not be wise to invade the sanctity of this place any further.  The
room is otherwise unremarkable, beside the fact that there are no seams in
the walls where roots come through and have made thick trunks in the
corners.

Passing the other guardians was the easy part, it seems.  You hear a low
moan and a creak as soon as the stone door slams shut behind you.  The
clanging song of chains ringing off a reel grates into your ears.  Two
wooden walls are fast approaching you, with stakes to close the deal, or
ordeal, of your life.  There are no hidden doors to save you, nor any refuge
to be found in the blind stone ceiling- what are you going to do now,
adventurer?

Dreaming the Dead~
A deadly lethargy settles over you as you enter this room; you feel
yourself slow, your footsteps grow heavy and leaden.  Even sound seems
prolonged and wearied in the dense air, as if time were slowing and with it
light and sensation.  The walls are smooth and rippled, mirror-like surfaces
reflecting warped visions of yourself back at you like your image on water
in a half remembered dream.  Perhaps you'll just...  Lie down, and take a
rest.

You hear slithering and skittering sounds in the all-absorbing darkness
of the cramped passage.  Drip, drip, drip...  Water dribbles from the
ceiling and down to the floor, soaking you from foot to knee.  Things
beneath the murk's unbreachable surface brush by your legs; slimy, long
things that sometimes stop to coil.  Roots under the black stillness hobble
you and loop around your feet, making it almost impossible to move easily. 
Other roots, some large and small, brush your face like the silken fingers
of cobwebs, leaving ooze blood-black in your light.

Dark Passage~
You can barely see the area in which you entered; northward the tight
passage narrows on into infinity.  The clammy water laps at your thighs,
creeping up into fabric and leather, making clothing cling uncomfortably. 
It will take forever to get out of metal armor and risks ruining supplies. 
The air is dank and smothering, making you yearn for the freedom of open
skies.  Oppressive pitch-blackness presses in on all sides, fingers of roots
grasping at you crookedly and slithering things beneath the water nipping
gently at you.

Dark Passage~
Through the darkness and over the blood-warm waters you see a glimmer of
light.  Though clutching roots may hold you back you feel the undeniable
urge to flee into the bright comfort of whatever is to the north in that
pulsing solar yellow.  The water is up to your waist now, but you feel it
begin to rise to the north; south, though, you can only see the unpierceable
pitch.

Sage~
This room is clean, dry, and thankfully well-lit.  After the suffocation
of the passage in here, you should be rather grateful.  The room itself is
rather barren; its form, however, is odd, that of a triangle, with a tripod
and green flame at each point.  In the center is a green rug that seems
brand new; upon it is a small black stand.  You can see something atop the
stand- what would that be?

Broken Vambrace~
Roots have created bars as strong as iron running from the ceiling to the
floor in this room, like a prison cell.  They block your further
exploration; if you want past them, it looks like you'll have to fight. 
Almost all of the stone of the room's founding has been strangled by scaley
roots; they trip you, grasp at you, tangle around you.  West is the most
blockage; east you can escape into the main hall.

Keen Dagger~
The walls and ceiling of this room are lined with daggers; even the floor
has regular spikes spaced exactly two paces apart from each other like a
gridwork of pins.  The silvered blades glint coldly in the light; the stone
spikes on the floor brush against your boots from time to time.  You feel
another presence in this clammy room; what is out there?  A few roots have
crept in through the ceiling, bunching around the daggers above.  Something
clatters to the floor behind you; a dagger has fallen.

Seeing the Soul~
Stepping into this humid chamber, you are assaulted by the smell of
ancient herbs moulding away and rotting wood.  This tiny crypt had once held
several precious artifacts, but they've obviously decomposed from the
ravages of water.  However, this apartment is untouched by the ever-present
roots- thank the gods for that.  In the center of the room, a rusted metal
sarcophagus protects the remains of some great priestess.  A white orb rests
in the west wall, somehow partially absorbed into the stone.

Tight Walls~
The dry gray floor slants up slightly, drawing you northward into
darkness.  Cracks run along the stone, as well as filaments of roots
pressing through with every advantage they can strangle.  There are unlit
sconces in the walls; this was once a used corridor, perhaps.  Several have
disintegrated, however, leaving only holes in the rock.

Tight Walls~
Shadows dispelled by the light creep around you, chilling you to the
core.  They writhe and claw like living things, with cold twisted hands
reaching out to snuff out the living.  The stone is frigid and your expelled
breath plumes into fog; a hard breeze rips through the narrow corridor from
the north, pushing you.  The slant in the floor has increased and a few
roots have made their way around the ground's blocks.

Tight Walls~
The floor is smooth and slippery here, the angle having risen
dramatically.  Roots provide footholds and purchase for you to continue;
north, you see what may be a chamber, and south are crawling shadows.

Gift~
The walls and floor of the round chamber are made of some strange rouge
stone whose surface is rough and cracked.  Beneath a rude green-lit
chandelier is a white altar, on which something gold glitters.

A Watery Grave~
There is either a wall to the south completely covered in roots or the
wooden snakes have completely blocked off the rest of the underground and
underwater tomb.  Is this a subterranean sea, you wonder to yourself, or
does it merely deepen into a hidden wellspring so far that it seems so? 
This crypt may even be older than the temple itself- it wasn't an uncommon
practice to build holy structures atop ancient consecrated ground.  East and
west you see the most decorated doors yet, with what seems to be bronze and
other soft metals dissolved across their surfaces.

Razhiel~
This chamber's floor is covered in moving water, making the roots beneath
it seem as if they're moving.  The clear water is ice cold and four feet
deep, effectively soaking you.  The wall above the water is uneroded, but
beneath has been eaten away by a handspan.

Clearing~
This room is lozenge-shaped, with a white circle in the center of the
uneven stone floor.  The stone smells wet but any water from the western
room has disappeared; there aren't even puddles on the damp floor.  A thin
layer of grime coats the walls, from what you cannot tell.

The Scepter of Zhylla~
Yet another round chamber; the stone walls are dry and dusty, but
moisture collects on the walls from ventiliation shafts in the floor that
lead down into moist darkness.  Three alcolves, equidistant from each other,
house small statues of Zhylla, a priest, and a treant.  The floor dips
slightly in the middle, forming a bowl.  In the center floats a polished
wooden staff, capped with something that looks suspiciously like a live
tree.

Kadomon~
In the center of the room a large channel has been dug to drain the water
from the chamber.  You can hear it gushing down some hidden shaft to the
south; where it goes, though, nobody knows.  The mildewy reek makes
breathing unpleasant, as well as the thick layer of dirt where a portion of
the southern wall caved under the pressure of thick roots.  West you see a
door that leads further into the crypt.

Adam~
Large tarnished bronze plates have been set into the walls, reaching from
floor to blackened ceiling.  There are eight of them in all, bodies of
long-dead priests and prophets.  On each is the sigil of a {wlily{x; these
must have been sacred over all clergy when this underground crypt was built.
Further west you see another door, while east you can return to the main
passage.

A God's Bones~
The walls of this gray room are streaked with patterns of cream white,
like the bones of something long dead.  Six of these ivory stripes lead to
the center of the chamber, where a round rose-colored orb lies.  A shaft of
light from a white disc in the ceiling illuminates it, making strange
ghostly figures as motes of dust travel in the disturbed air.
